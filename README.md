## ðŸ¤” What is ConSol?

**ConSol** is a framework to solve any problems, primarily mathematical problems but applicable to any, with leveraging a statistical approach to suppress randomness, and to result higher accuracy cost-efficiently.

* **Higher Accuracy**: ConSol improves [OpenAI's GPT-o3-mini-medium](.) performance on [AIME24 Benchmark](.) by 20%p from 73% to 93%.
* **Cost Efficiency**: ConSol can reduce from 50% to 66% of output tokens of [OpenAI's GPT-o3-mini-medium](.) for [AIME24 Benchmark](.). The number of output tokens is directly linked to the money cost. The money saving with ConSol is $50, $16, $4 for o3-mini-high, o3-mini-medium, o3-mini-low, respectively.
